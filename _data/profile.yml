    I am a last-year PhD student in <a href="https://polyunlp.github.io/" target="_blank">PolyU NLP Group</a> at <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a>, fortunately advised by Prof. <a href="https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/" target="_blank">Maggie, Wenjie Li</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before that, I received my MSc and BMgt degrees from <a href="https://english.hust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recently, I am interested in <strong>LLM-based reasoning</strong> and <strong>Medical AI</strong>. The specific topics include:
    <ul>
      <li>Math Reasoningâ€”<strong>subtle errors</strong> in reasoning and optimization strategies with <strong>jumping-start initialization</strong>;</li>
      <li>LLM Evaluationâ€”<strong>robust multi-faceted</strong> evaluation and diverse test-scaling approaches;</li>
      <li>Clinician-like Medical Dialogue Systemsâ€”<strong>structured</strong> clinical communication, comprehensive <strong>differential diagnosis</strong>, and prototypical <strong>clinical reasoning</strong> processes;</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    ðŸ”¥ I am available on the job market and actively looking for industry opportunities!
