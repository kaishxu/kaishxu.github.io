  In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or computation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines the training objective without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference annotation.
