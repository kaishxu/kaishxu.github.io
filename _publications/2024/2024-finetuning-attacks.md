  We break down the safeguarding process of an LLM when encountered with harmful instructions into three stages: (1) recognizing harmful instructions, (2) generating an initial refusing tone, and (3) completing the refusal response. Accordingly, we investigate whether and how different attack strategies could influence each stage of this safeguarding process.
