  We propose a medical dialogue generation framework with the Intuitive-then-Analytic Differential Diagnosis (IADDx). Our method starts with a differential diagnosis via retrieval-based intuitive association and subsequently refines it through a graph-enhanced analytic procedure. The resulting differential diagnosis is then used to retrieve medical knowledge and guide response generation.
