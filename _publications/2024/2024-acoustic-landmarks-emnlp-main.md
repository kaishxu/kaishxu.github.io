  We investigate an efficient method for depression detection by integrating speech signals into LLMs utilizing Acoustic Landmarks. By incorporating acoustic landmarks, which are specific to the pronunciation of spoken words, our method adds critical dimensions to text transcripts. This integration also provides insights into the unique speech patterns of individuals, revealing the potential mental states of individuals.
